# Integral-with-Trapezoidal-Rule
*Project Objective*  

In mathematics, and more specifically in numerical analysis, the trapezoidal rule (also known as the trapezoid rule or trapezium rule) is a technique for approximating the definite integral. The trapezoidal rule works by approximating the region under the graph of the function as a trapezoid and calculating its area. Purpose of project creating a program with DEV C++ which can solve integral with trapezoidal rule.
